# peniko, a Rust 2D graphics type library
The peniko library builds on top of [kurbo] and provides a set of generic types that define
styles for rendering and composition. 

The name "peniko" is Esperanto for "brush" which is one family of types that the library
contains.

This library is in early development stages and will initially contain the useful types
from [piet-scene] but the intent is to
be a generally useful set of primitives.
